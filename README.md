# metric-conv-gui

Welcome to the metric converter! Enter any number into the textbox. Then, select which unit conversion you would like to do. The conversion you select (on the buttons below) will be performed.

For example, if you entered '12' (without quotation marks) and then select 'cm to in', 12 cm will be converted to 4.72 in.

Each time the user clicks a button, the terminal will say that button was pressed. The program uses JavaFX tools to create its window. Note that this is unimportant to the user.
